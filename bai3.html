    <p>One particular book which is recommended <br> reading is <u>The Street Lawyer</u> by <u>John Grisham</u>. <br> This book is about a lawyer who begins re- <br> evaluating his priorities in life 
    when a bad <br> incident occurs within his law firm. Consequently, <br> he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, <br> and realizes

    is a <b>great</b> book. It is <b>well written <br> </b> and <b>interesting</b>. Other books by <u>John Grisham <br></u> included
    <u>The Firm</u>, <u>The Pelican Brief</u>, and <u>The <br> Cilent.</u></p>
